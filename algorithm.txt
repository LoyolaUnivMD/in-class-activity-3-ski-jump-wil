        create scanner object
        get input for hill type
        get input for speed

        if hill type is normal
            set par, ppm, and height to pre-set values for normal hill
            do math operations to find out time in air using Math.sqrt((2*height)/9.8)
            find out what distance travelled is using speed * times
            find out what points is using 60+(distance-par)*ppm
            round distance and points to 2 decimal places
            output how far they went and how many points they got

            if points is greater than 61
                Output you did better than par

            else if points is less than or equal to 10
                Output What happened??

            else
                Output sorry you didnt go very far

        else if hill type is large
                    set par, ppm, and height to pre-set values for normal hill
                    do math operations to find out time in air using Math.sqrt((2*height)/9.8)
